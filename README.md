# Arranca con fuerza

This is a project granted through CoderHouse to their TOP 10 students in order to get real experience of things learned through the Web Development course. This involved creating static page using [ReactJS](https://es.reactjs.org/), using [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) as library.
Design was provided by a fellow UX Designer through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/xLeCEJJgtGGxcJenJTc1K6/Untitled?node-id=38%3A5)(veiwing premission required).

Being a static page it is basically aimed for users to get an overview of clients product and then contact via social networks.
